debugging...

what do we notice?

1. we find that the temperature fields are not caclulating
	a. maybe the maxIter entry is 0 thats why
	b. maybe we need to enter an entry for calculating e
	c. fvSchemes...

trial solution: 
add the entry for e in fvSolution, 
add the entry for Gauss linear instead of bounded Gauss LimitedLinear for fvSchemes

trial solution results: doesn't help calculate T

trial solution: delete maxIter 0 entry

it seems to work!! the combination of changing fvSolution and fvSchemes has allowed the simulation to work!!



2. we find that the temperature profile is not alternating according to the csv file
a. is it due to sampling time too long?
(not the issue)


3. so setting writeinterval to 1s after copying the case doesnt show the desired results
a. partly solved
(not the issue)





4. maybe the timevarying BC is to blame...

timevarying BC is NOT to blame
